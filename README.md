# Play_store_analysis

Introduction: This dataset takes a deep dive into the large dataset of Google playstore app, with a goal of finding the visual insights about the app trends, user reviews and etc . By finding the sentiment behind reviews, app categories, installation of the apps reveals the pattern for the success of the app

Background: This project focused on analyzing Play Store data a closer look at app metrics such as ratings, reviews, installs, and categories.The goal is to find trends, understand user behavior.This involves techniques like data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis to find the our main goal.

Learning Objectives: The project is all about honing skills in data cleaning, doing exploratary data analysis, cerating visiualiation through python libraries such as pandas, numpy, plotly. Here I got experience with real world datasets to understands the trends and what makes the app so popular.

Activities and Tasks: The task that is given are :
                    1) Visualize the sentiment distribution (positive, neutral, negative) of user reviews using a stacked bar chart, segmented by rating groups (e.g., 1-2 stars, 3-4 stars, 4-5 stars). Include only apps with more than 1,000 reviews and group by the top 5 categories.
                    2) Create an interactive Choropleth map using Plotly to visualize global installs by Category. Apply filters to show data for only the top 5 app categories and highlight category where the number of installs exceeds 1 million. The app category should not start with the characters “A,” “C,” “G,” or “S.” This graph should work only between 6 PM IST and 8 PM IST; apart from that time, we should not show it in the dashboard itself.
                    3)Create a violin plot to visualize the distribution of ratings for each app category, but only include categories with more than 50 apps and app name should contain letter “C” and exclude apps with fewer than 10 reviews and rating should be less 4.0. this graph should work only between 4 PM IST to 6 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.
These are the task that are given.

Skills and Competencies: For doing Google play store data analysis one should know skills such as data cleaning , Exploratory data analysis ,and also competencies on python libraries which are numpy, pandas, ploty, and etc

Feedback and Evidence: The evidence we have consist of summary showing how ratings are distributed, the relationship between size and number of installs.Feedback is that we should do more  analysis in user review to understand their sentiment and feature request

Challenges and Solutions: The challenges that are faced are handling missing values, inconsistent formats, incorrect datatypes, extracting meaningful insights from reviews. Solutions are using python libraries(numpy,pandas) for data cleaning, incorrect datatypes, using NLP for sentiment analysis for reviews, using plotly for visualization of graphs

Outcomes and Impact: The outcomes are focused on identifying fast growing app and figuring out what influences user feelings, this helps the devolopers to make changes in app that increases its marketing strategies and engagement.Its impact very muuch that how important user reviews and apps ratings are.

Conclusion: By analyzing data from the Play Store it show some important trends that affect the performance of the apps.It shows how user rating linked to user review, most common apps are free app , Games and communication apps are most high rating and etc. So this google playstore analysis is very important for the app.
